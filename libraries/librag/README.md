# librag

<!-- BEGIN:description — Do not edit. Generated from package.json. -->

Consolidated retrieval CLIs — build the knowledge indexes, then query them by
meaning or relationship.

<!-- END:description -->

## Getting Started

`librag` aggregates the retrieval-augmented-generation CLI surface into two
binaries. It holds no processing or query logic of its own — each subcommand
constructs the same index and processor its predecessor did and delegates to
`libresource`, `libgraph`, and `libvector`.

- **`fit-process`** — build the indexes. `resources` turns HTML into the
  `resources` index; `graphs` turns resources into the `graphs` index;
  `vectors` turns resources into the `vectors` index.
- **`fit-rag`** — query the indexes. `search` ranks the `vectors` index by
  meaning; `query` answers triple patterns over the `graphs` index; `subjects`
  lists graph subjects by type.

```sh
# Build, then query
fit-process resources --base https://example.invalid/
fit-process graphs
fit-process vectors
fit-rag query "?" rdf:type schema:Person
```

Only `fit-process vectors` and `fit-rag search` need the embedding service; the
other subcommands run offline.

## Documentation

- [Search Semantically](https://www.forwardimpact.team/docs/libraries/ground-agents/search-semantically/index.md)
  — find related content by meaning with ranked results from a vector index
  (`fit-rag search`), no vector database required.
- [Query a Knowledge Graph](https://www.forwardimpact.team/docs/libraries/ground-agents/query-graph/index.md)
  — answer relationship questions from an RDF graph index with triple-pattern
  queries (`fit-rag query`) and type-filtered subject listings
  (`fit-rag subjects`).
- [Give Agents Typed, Retrievable Knowledge](https://www.forwardimpact.team/docs/libraries/ground-agents/index.md)
  — the full workflow for building the graph and vector indexes from HTML
  knowledge sources, then querying them.
