    type:
      Entity type URI to filter by (e.g., "schema:Organization", "schema:Drug").

query_by_pattern:
  purpose: |
    Retrieves structured data by traversing graph relationships using RDF
    triple patterns (subject-predicate-object).
  applicability: |
    Use after get_ontology and get_subjects to query relationships between
    specific entities. Retrieves factual structured data.
  instructions: |
    Input: Optional 'subject', 'predicate', 'object' fields. Use '?' for wildcards.
    Example: (subject=entity-uri, predicate="schema:member", object=?)
    Output: Array of matching content.
  evaluation: |
    Structured facts matching the triple pattern.
  parameters:
    subject: Subject URI of the triple pattern (use "?" as wildcard).
    predicate: Predicate URI defining the relationship (use "?" as wildcard).
    object: Object URI or literal value (use "?" as wildcard).

search_content:
  purpose: |
    Find detailed content using semantic similarity search.
  applicability: |
    Use for "what is X", "how does Y work", or when graph queries insufficient.
  instructions: |
    Input: Text query in 'input' field.
    Optional: 'limit' and 'threshold' for filtering.
  evaluation: |
    Array of detailed content strings matching your query.
  parameters:
    input: Text queries to search for using semantic similarity.

sha256_hash:
  purpose: |
    Generate a deterministic SHA-256 cryptographic hash of input text for
    security, verification, or identification purposes.
  applicability: |
    SEQUENCING: Independent utility - no sequencing requirements.
    Use ONLY when user explicitly requests SHA-256 hashing functionality.
    DO NOT use for search, content analysis, or similarity detection.
    Reserved for security, verification, and identification use cases.
  instructions: |
    Input: Text string in 'input' field to be hashed.
    Output: Deterministic 64-character hexadecimal SHA-256 hash string.
    Hash is cryptographically secure and suitable for verification purposes.
  evaluation: |
    Returns exactly 64-character hexadecimal string representing the SHA-256
    hash of the input text.
  parameters:
    input: Text string to be hashed using SHA-256 algorithm.

md5_hash:
  purpose: |
    Generate an MD5 hash of input text for legacy compatibility or quick
    checksums (note: MD5 is not cryptographically secure).
  applicability: |
    SEQUENCING: Independent utility - no sequencing requirements.
    Use ONLY when user explicitly requests MD5 hashing functionality.
    DO NOT use for search, content analysis, or security purposes.
    Reserved for legacy compatibility and non-security checksums.
  instructions: |
    Input: Text string in 'input' field to be hashed.
    Output: 32-character hexadecimal MD5 hash string.
    Note: MD5 is not cryptographically secure - use SHA-256 for security.
  evaluation: |
    Returns exactly 32-character hexadecimal string representing the MD5
    hash of the input text.
  parameters:
    input: Text string to be hashed using MD5 algorithm.

list_sub_agents:
  purpose: |
    List available sub-agents that can be invoked for delegation.
  applicability: |
    Use to discover which agents are available for sub-agent invocation.
    Only agents with infer=true will be returned.
  instructions: |
    No input parameters. Returns list of agent IDs available for delegation.
  evaluation: |
    List of agent IDs that can be passed to run_sub_agent.
  parameters: {}

run_sub_agent:
  purpose: |
    Run a sub-agent with a specific task in an isolated child conversation.
  applicability: |
    Use when delegating a specific task to another agent. The sub-agent
    executes in isolation and returns results without affecting the
    current conversation context.
  instructions: |
    Input: 'agent_id' (from list_sub_agents) and 'prompt' (task description).
    Output: Sub-agent response with generated messages.
  evaluation: |
    Complete response from the sub-agent for the delegated task.
  parameters:
    agent_id: Identifier of the sub-agent to invoke (from list_sub_agents).
    prompt: Task description or instructions for the sub-agent to execute.

list_handoffs:
  purpose: |
    List valid handoff labels available from the current agent.
  applicability: |
    Use to discover which handoffs are configured for the current agent
    before executing a handoff.
  instructions: |
    No input parameters (uses current conversation context).
    Returns list of handoff labels.
  evaluation: |
    List of labels that can be passed to run_handoff.
  parameters: {}

run_handoff:
  purpose: |
    Hand off conversation control to another agent.
  applicability: |
    Use when the current task requires a different agent's expertise.
    The handoff transfers the full conversation context to the target agent.
  instructions: |
    Input: 'label' (from list_handoffs).
    Output: Confirmation of handoff with new agent ID.
  evaluation: |
    Conversation control transferred to the target agent.
  parameters:
    label: Handoff label identifying the target agent (from list_handoffs).
