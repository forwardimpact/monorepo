Quarterly review is due and the only data is ticket counts — singling out
individuals, not illuminating the system. Career conversations feel subjective
with no shared evidence base. Landmark resolves both by surfacing marker
evidence — assessed by Guide against your engineering standard — alongside
developer-experience outcomes, presented without blaming individuals.

## What becomes possible

### For Engineering Leaders

Demonstrate engineering progress without making individuals feel surveilled.
See system-level trends that show direction, tell whether culture investments
are working before the next budget cycle, and ground quarterly reviews in
evidence rather than impressions.

- Team health dashboards combining evidence, driver scores, and engineer voice
- GetDX snapshot trends and quarterly comparisons
- Practice pattern analysis showing which skills are actively exercised

### For Empowered Engineers

See what your recent work demonstrates against the standard, and how it adds
up over time. When Guide recommends a growth area, Landmark is where the proof
of progress shows up.

- Marker evidence linking GitHub artifacts to skill definitions
- Promotion readiness and growth timeline views
- Skill coverage analysis against standard markers

## How Landmark Works

### Audience Model

| Audience                | Views                                                                         | Privacy                                   |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Engineer** (own data) | `evidence`, `readiness`, `timeline`, `coverage`, `sources`, `voice --email`   | Full individual detail                    |
| **Manager** (1:1 tool)  | `health`, `readiness`, `timeline`, `practiced`, `practice`, `voice --manager` | Individual specificity for direct reports |
| **Director** (planning) | `snapshot`, `practiced`, `practice`, `voice --manager`                        | Aggregated team views                     |

### Commands

#### Organization

```sh
npx fit-landmark org show                    # Full organization directory
npx fit-landmark org team --manager <email>  # Hierarchy under a manager
```

#### Snapshots

```sh
npx fit-landmark snapshot list
npx fit-landmark snapshot show --snapshot <id> [--manager <email>]
npx fit-landmark snapshot trend --item <item_id> [--manager <email>]
npx fit-landmark snapshot compare --snapshot <id> [--manager <email>]
```

#### Evidence & Readiness

```sh
npx fit-landmark evidence [--skill <id>] [--email <email>]
npx fit-landmark marker <skill> [--level <level>]
npx fit-landmark readiness --email <email> [--target <level>]
npx fit-landmark timeline --email <email> [--skill <id>]
npx fit-landmark coverage --email <email>
npx fit-landmark practiced --manager <email>
npx fit-landmark practice [--skill <id>] [--manager <email>]
```

#### Engineer Data

```sh
npx fit-landmark sources [--email <email>]
```

Inventory of activity row classes Landmark retains about an engineer —
transparency view for the engineer asking what data the system holds.

#### Health

```sh
npx fit-landmark health [--manager <email>]
npx fit-landmark health [--manager <email>] --verbose
```

Default output is a compact table of drivers with one anchor per row; pass
`--verbose` for the full per-driver paragraph layout including all percentile
anchors, GetDX comments, and contributing-skill evidence.

Sample default output:

```
  Team — health view

  Drivers (6)
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  #  Driver          Percentile  vs_org   More
  1  Quality         42nd        -10      +4 anchors via --verbose
  2  Reliability     n/a         n/a      -
  …
```

#### Engineer Voice

```sh
npx fit-landmark voice --manager <email>   # Themed team comments
npx fit-landmark voice --email <email>     # Individual comment timeline
```

All commands support `--format text|json|markdown`.

### Prerequisites

- **GetDX account** with API access configured
- **Map** with the activity schema migrated (`npx fit-map activity migrate`)
- **Standard data** with drivers and markers authored in your capability YAML

### Data Flow

Landmark reads from Map's activity layer:

1. `organization_people` for hierarchy and team slicing
2. `github_artifacts` + `evidence` for marker analysis — Guide assesses artifacts against your standard's markers and writes results to Map
3. `getdx_snapshots` + `getdx_snapshot_team_scores` for quarterly outcomes
4. `getdx_snapshot_comments` for engineer voice

```
GitHub + GetDX → Map (ingest + store) → Landmark (present)
                       ↑                       ↑
              Guide (marker analysis)    Summit (recommendations)
```

Health works without Summit — it shows driver scores, evidence, and comments.
Growth recommendations appear when Summit is installed.

## Getting Started

```sh
npm install @forwardimpact/landmark @forwardimpact/map
npx fit-map init                            # seed ./data/pathway/ with the starter standard
npx fit-landmark marker task-completion     # reference view — no Supabase required
```

The rest of Landmark (`health`, `voice`, `snapshot`, `evidence`, …) reads
from Map's activity layer. Walk that setup in the per-persona guides below.
