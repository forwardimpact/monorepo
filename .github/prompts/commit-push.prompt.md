# Commit and Push Changes

Commit all staged and unstaged changes, then push to remote.

Follow the conventions in `.github/instructions/git-workflow.instructions.md`.

## Process

1. Run `git diff` to review all changes
2. Group related changes into logical, atomic commits
3. Separate feature/logic changes from formatting changes
4. Run `npm run check` to validate changes
5. Push all commits to remote
