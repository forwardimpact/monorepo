### What Guide is

Guide is an AI agent that reasons about your engineering framework. It
understands your skills, levels, behaviours, disciplines, tracks, and career
progression — not as static text, but as structured data it can think about in
context.

Ask Guide a question and it answers with your framework in mind:

- "What should I focus on to reach the next level?" — Guide knows your current
  role, your target, and the specific skills that change between them
- "How does our team approach code review?" — Guide references your team's
  actual review standards, not generic best practices
- "I'm new — where do I start?" — Guide walks you through your team's skill
  expectations and conventions for your level

### What Guide does

- **Onboarding** — helps new engineers orient in unfamiliar teams, grounded in
  the team's actual skill framework and level expectations
- **Career advice** — recommends growth areas based on gap analysis between
  where you are and where you want to go
- **Skill assessment** — observes engineering activity and interprets it against
  the framework, giving Landmark the judgement it needs to match evidence to
  markers
- **Contextual help** — references the right skills, behaviours, and
  conventions for your level when you need guidance
- **Problem-solving** — assists with engineering decisions informed by your
  team's standards and patterns

### Stay Updated

Guide is currently in development. The foundation is being built in the Map,
Pathway, and Basecamp products. When these are mature, Guide will bring them
together — an AI assistant that understands not just engineering in general, but
engineering at your organization.
