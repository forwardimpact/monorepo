# Knowledge Management

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when:

- Creating or organizing knowledge bases
- Documenting institutional knowledge
- Reducing single-person dependencies
- Establishing knowledge sharing practices
- Making information discoverable

## Knowledge Capture

### What to Document

- **Decisions**: Why we chose X over Y
- **Context**: What we knew when we decided
- **Procedures**: How to do recurring tasks
- **Troubleshooting**: Common problems and solutions
- **Architecture**: How systems work and why

### When to Capture

- After making significant decisions
- After solving novel problems
- Before someone leaves or changes roles
- When you explain something more than twice
- During incident post-mortems

## Knowledge Organization

### Structure Principles

- Organize by task, not by team
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Create clear navigation paths
- Link related content together
- Maintain a clear hierarchy

### Discoverability

- Searchable titles and headings
- Keywords and tags for filtering
- Landing pages for major topics
- Recently updated sections visible
- Cross-linking between related docs

## Knowledge Maintenance

### Keep Current

- Review docs when code changes
- Date-stamp time-sensitive content
- Archive rather than delete outdated info
- Assign ownership for key documents
- Schedule periodic review cycles

### Quality Standards

- Clear ownership for each document
- Last-updated dates visible
- Contact for questions listed
- Review schedule defined
- Deprecation process documented

## Reducing Knowledge Silos

### Identify Risks

- Single points of knowledge failure
- Undocumented tribal knowledge
- Expertise concentrated in individuals
- Critical processes in one person's head

### Mitigation Strategies

- Pair programming and shadowing
- Recorded walkthroughs for complex systems
- Cross-training sessions
- Written runbooks for critical processes
- Regular knowledge sharing meetings
