        ## When to use this skill

        Use this skill when:
        - Setting up or modifying CI/CD pipelines
        - Containerizing applications with Docker
        - Managing infrastructure as code
        - Troubleshooting deployment failures
        - Implementing monitoring and alerting

        ## CI/CD Pipeline Stages

        ### Build
        - Install dependencies
        - Compile/transpile code
        - Generate artifacts
        - Cache dependencies for speed

        ### Test
        - Run unit tests
        - Run integration tests
        - Static analysis and linting
        - Security scanning

        ### Deploy
        - Deploy to staging environment
        - Run smoke tests
        - Deploy to production
        - Verify deployment health

        ## Infrastructure as Code

        ### Terraform
        ```hcl
        # Define resources declaratively
        resource "aws_instance" "example" {
          ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
          instance_type = "t2.micro"
        }
        ```

        ### Docker
        ```dockerfile
        FROM node:18-alpine
        WORKDIR /app
        COPY package*.json ./
        RUN npm ci --only=production
        COPY . .
        CMD ["node", "server.js"]
        ```

        ## Deployment Strategies

        ### Rolling Deployment
        - Gradual replacement of instances
        - Zero downtime
        - Easy rollback

        ### Blue-Green Deployment
        - Two identical environments
        - Switch traffic atomically
        - Fast rollback

        ### Canary Deployment
        - Route small percentage to new version
        - Monitor for issues
        - Gradually increase traffic

        ## When to use this skill

        Use this skill when:
        - Designing monitoring and alerting
        - Defining SLIs, SLOs, and error budgets
        - Handling or preparing for incidents
        - Conducting post-mortems
        - Planning for capacity and resilience

        ## Service Level Concepts

        ### SLI (Service Level Indicator)
        Quantitative measure of service behavior:
        - Request latency (p50, p95, p99)
        - Error rate (% of failed requests)
        - Availability (% of successful requests)
        - Throughput (requests per second)

        ### SLO (Service Level Objective)
        Target value for an SLI:
        - "99.9% of requests complete in < 200ms"
        - "Error rate < 0.1% over 30 days"
        - "99.95% availability monthly"

        ### Error Budget
        Allowed unreliability: 100% - SLO
        - 99.9% SLO = 0.1% error budget
        - ~43 minutes downtime per month
        - Spend on features or reliability

        ## Observability

        ### Three Pillars
        - **Metrics**: Aggregated numeric data (counters, gauges, histograms)
        - **Logs**: Discrete event records with context
        - **Traces**: Request flow across services

        ### Alerting Principles
        - Alert on symptoms, not causes
        - Every alert should be actionable
        - Reduce noise ruthlessly
        - Page only for user-impacting issues
        - Use severity levels appropriately

        ## Incident Response

        ### Incident Lifecycle
        1. **Detection**: Automated alerts or user reports
        2. **Triage**: Assess severity and impact
        3. **Mitigation**: Stop the bleeding first
        4. **Resolution**: Fix the underlying issue
        5. **Post-mortem**: Learn and improve

        ### During an Incident
        - Communicate early and often
        - Focus on mitigation before root cause
        - Document actions in real-time
        - Escalate when needed
        - Update stakeholders regularly

        ## Post-Mortem Process

        ### Blameless Culture
        - Focus on systems, not individuals
        - Assume good intentions
        - Ask "how did the system allow this?"
        - Share findings openly

        ### Post-Mortem Template
        1. Incident summary
        2. Timeline of events
        3. Root cause analysis
        4. What went well
        5. What could be improved
        6. Action items with owners

        ## Resilience Patterns

        - **Timeouts**: Don't wait forever
        - **Retries**: With exponential backoff
        - **Circuit breakers**: Fail fast when downstream is unhealthy
        - **Bulkheads**: Isolate failures
        - **Graceful degradation**: Partial functionality over total failure

        ## SRE Checklist

        - [ ] SLIs defined for key user journeys
        - [ ] SLOs set with stakeholder agreement
        - [ ] Error budget tracking in place
        - [ ] Alerts are actionable and low-noise
        - [ ] Runbooks exist for common issues
        - [ ] Incident response process documented
        - [ ] Post-mortem culture established
        - [ ] Resilience patterns implemented
