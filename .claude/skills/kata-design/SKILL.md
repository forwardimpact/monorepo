  Create design documents (WHICH/WHERE) for approved specs. A design is a
  max-200-line architectural sketch — components, interfaces, data flow, and
  key decisions with trade-offs — that gives reviewers a high-leverage point
  to redirect architecture before the full plan is written. Design is approved
  when its PR carries the `design:approved` label or an APPROVED review.

# Write and Review Designs

A design defines WHICH components exist, WHERE they interact, and what
interfaces connect them. Design sits in the
[spec](../kata-spec/SKILL.md) → design → [plan](../kata-plan/SKILL.md) →
[implement](../kata-implement/SKILL.md) pipeline: the spec captures WHAT/WHY,
the design captures WHICH/WHERE, the plan captures HOW/WHEN, and implementation
executes the plan.

**A design requires an existing approved spec.** Without an approved spec there
is no commitment to implement, and a design has nothing to shape.

## When to Use

- Turning a merged spec (`specs/NNN/spec.md` on `origin/main`, not just a
  `spec:approved` label on an open PR) into an architectural design
- Reviewing a design before approval ("review design NNN", "is design NNN
  ready?")
- Revisiting a design whose direction needs rethinking before planning

## Checklists

<read_do_checklist goal="Internalize design-writing boundaries before starting">

- [ ] Confirm `specs/NNN/spec.md` exists on `origin/main` after
      `git fetch origin main`. A `spec:approved` label on an open PR is not
      sufficient — wait for the merge.
- [ ] Do not write or revise the spec — return it to `draft` if it needs
      changes.
- [ ] Do not write the plan — this skill writes the design; `kata-plan`
      translates it into implementation steps.
- [ ] One design per spec — do not bundle multiple specs into one design.
- [ ] Read the spec end-to-end before writing. Restate problem, scope, and
      success criteria without referring back.

</read_do_checklist>

<do_confirm_checklist goal="Verify design quality before recommending approval">

- [ ] Components, interfaces, and data flow stated before detail.
- [ ] Each key decision names a rejected alternative and why.
- [ ] Mermaid diagrams used where they clarify structure.
- [ ] Stays within spec scope and at the architectural level — no scope
      expansion; names components, classes, interfaces, and data structures but
      not file-level changes, execution ordering, or implementation steps (those
      belong in the plan).
- [ ] Under 200 lines total.
- [ ] Clean sub-agent review panel of `design-a.md` via
      [`kata-review`](../kata-review/SKILL.md) completed (fresh context, no
      prior bias, panel size per caller protocol) and every **blocker**,
      **high**, and **medium** finding addressed.
- [ ] Run `bun run format:fix` before pushing — commit any changes the formatter
      makes.
- [ ] Grep `design-a.md` against breaking renames on `main` since branch
      divergence —
      `git log origin/main --since '14 days ago' --grep '^feat!:\|^fix!:'`
      enumerates breaking commits; for each, grep `design-a.md` for the renamed
      identifier and update before push.
- [ ] After push, verify the design landed on origin —
      `git ls-tree origin/<branch> -- specs/<NNN-slug>/design-a.md` returns a
      blob. Empty output means the push did not persist (phantom write); re-push
      and re-verify before signaling approval.

## Naming Convention

Designs live alongside their spec in `specs/{NNN}-{name}/`.

### Default design

The first (and usually only) design is always **`design-a.md`**. Do not use
`design.md` or other shorthands — the letter suffix keeps naming consistent
whether one design or several exist.

### Alternative designs

When exploring competing architectural approaches for the same spec, create
additional variants using sequential letters:

```
design-a.md    ← default (always created first)
design-b.md    ← alternative approach
design-c.md    ← another alternative
```

Each variant should open with a brief rationale explaining how it differs from
design-a. When the design is approved, **design-a is the design that will be
planned** unless the approver explicitly selects a different variant.

No decomposition — if a design cannot fit in 200 lines, narrow the spec instead.

## Writing a Design (WHICH + WHERE)

The design answers: which components exist, where they interact, and what
interfaces connect them — and why this architecture over alternatives.

- **Architecture, not execution.** Name components, interfaces, data flow. Do
  not specify file-level changes or execution ordering — those belong in the
  plan.
- **Decisions with trade-offs.** Each architectural choice names at least one
  rejected alternative and why.
- **One home per decision.** If a decision has a `## Key Decisions` table row,
  do not also write a `Rejected:` paragraph under its section. Table or prose,
  not both.
- **Visual when possible.** Mermaid diagrams for component relationships, data
  flow, state machines, sequence diagrams.
- **Scope-faithful.** Stay within the spec's scope. If scope should change,
  return the spec to draft rather than expanding silently.

**Form follows content.** Prefer tables for lists with shared structure
(components, decisions). Prefer bullets for flat facts. Use prose only for the
narrative thread between them. If a paragraph could be a row, make it a row. Do
not restate what the artifact already shows.

## Approval

A design is approved when its PR carries the `design:approved` label **or** has
an APPROVED review by a trusted account. Once the design PR merges,
`specs/NNN/design-a.md` exists on `main` and the phase is by definition
complete. See
[`coordination-protocol.md` § Approval signal](../../agents/references/coordination-protocol.md#approval-signal).

## Reviewing a Design

Evaluate `design-a.md` against the qualities listed in "Writing a Design" above,
then run the DO-CONFIRM checklist at the top of this skill.

If all criteria are met, apply the approval signal:

```sh
gh pr edit <number> --add-label design:approved
```

If any criterion falls short, request changes via PR comment — do not apply the
label.

## Process

### Step 0: Read Memory

Read memory per the agent profile (your summary, the current week's log, and
teammates' summaries). Extract specs previously designed and any deferred work
from prior entries.

### Step 1: Find the spec

Run `git fetch origin main`, then confirm `specs/NNN/spec.md` exists on
`origin/main`. An open PR with a `spec:approved` label is not sufficient — wait
for the merge.

### Step 2: Study the spec

Read `spec.md` end to end.

### Step 3: Research the codebase

Read the code areas the spec targets.

### Step 4: Write the design

Create `design-a.md`. Stay under 200 lines. Each architectural choice names a
rejected alternative.

### Step 5: Open a design PR

The PR title carries the spec id: `design(NNN): …`.

### Step 6: Clean sub-agent review panel

Follow the [`kata-review` caller
protocol](../kata-review/references/caller-protocol.md). Tell each reviewer not
to invoke `kata-design`. Address every confirmed blocker/high/medium finding
before advancing.

### Step 7: Apply approval signal

When the panel passes, run `gh pr edit <number> --add-label design:approved`.

## Memory: what to record

Append to the current week's log (see agent profile for the file path):

- **Specs designed** — Spec number, name, and status transition
- **Design decisions** — Key architectural choices and why (so the planner has
  context)
- **Deferred specs** — Specs skipped and why (not approved, missing info, etc.)

- **Metrics** — Append one row per run to `wiki/metrics/{skill}/`
  per `references/metrics.md`. See KATA.md § Metrics for the
  recording-eligibility rule.
