# Write and Review Documentation

Write effective documentation and systematically review it for accuracy. Two
modes of operation:

- **Scheduled review** — Pick one topic, go deep, verify against source code.
- **Interactive writing** — Write or update pages following the standards.

## When to Use

- Scheduled documentation review (one topic per run)
- Writing or updating pages in `websites/`
- Auditing documentation accuracy against source code

## Checklists

<read_do_checklist goal="Load documentation standards before starting">

- [ ] Read [`references/standards.md`](references/standards.md) — audience
      rules, formatting conventions, terminology.
- [ ] Read [`references/source-of-truth.md`](references/source-of-truth.md) —
      which code/data backs each documentation claim.
- [ ] Identify the audience for every page touched — do not mix contributor
      content into user-facing pages or vice versa.
- [ ] Verify claims against source code, not against other documentation.

</read_do_checklist>

<do_confirm_checklist goal="Confirm documentation review is complete">

- [ ] Every CLI example on the page was executed and output verified.
- [ ] Every YAML example was checked against JSON schema.
- [ ] Audience purity confirmed (no audience mixing).
- [ ] Source of truth consulted and docs match current code.
- [ ] All cross-links resolve.
- [ ] `fit-doc build --src=websites/<site> --out=dist` succeeds for
      every site touched.
- [ ] Terminology matches conventions in `references/standards.md`.

</do_confirm_checklist>

## Process

### Step 0: Read Memory

Read `wiki/MEMORY.md`, then run `gemba-wiki boot --agent <self>` per
[memory-protocol § On-Boot Read Set](../../agents/x-memory-protocol.md#on-boot-read-set).
The digest's `owned_priorities`, `claims`, and `storyboard_items` seed this
Process. Find last review dates per topic in the coverage map.

> **Writing under `.claude/`:** If this run edits files under `.claude/skills/`,
> follow
> [self-improvement.md](../../agents/x-self-improvement.md).

### Step 1: Route by mode

Scheduled runs review one topic in depth — continue with § Scheduled Review.
Interactive runs write or update pages — continue with § Interactive Writing.

## Scheduled Review

Each run covers **one topic** in depth.

### Topic areas

| Topic                    | What to review                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `getting-started`        | `websites/<site>/docs/getting-started/` — onboarding accuracy, CLI examples               |
| `products`               | `websites/<site>/docs/products/` — product-task accuracy, audience purity, completeness   |
| `libraries`              | `websites/<site>/docs/libraries/` — library-task accuracy, audience purity, completeness  |
| `services`               | `websites/<site>/docs/services/` — service-task accuracy, audience purity, completeness   |
| `reference`              | `websites/<site>/docs/reference/` — CLI synopsis, entity definitions, schema              |
| `internals`              | `websites/<site>/docs/internals/` — architecture accuracy, code path validity             |
| `product-pages`          | Product overview pages under `websites/<site>/` — overviews                               |
| `root-docs`              | `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `KATA.md`, `SECURITY.md`                                  |
| `llms-txt-and-seo`       | `websites/<site>/llms.txt`, `websites/<site>/robots.txt`, sitemap completeness            |
| `cross-page-consistency` | Terminology, proficiency scales, field names across all pages                             |

### Topic selection

1. Build coverage map — never-reviewed topics go first, then oldest.
2. Revisit threshold — if all topics covered within last 6 runs, revisit oldest.
3. Announce your pick and why before starting.
4. Go deep — read every page in the topic area, not just spot-check.

### Review process

1. Read every page in the topic area.
2. For each page, identify the source of truth (per
   [`references/source-of-truth.md`](references/source-of-truth.md)).
3. Read the actual source code/data and compare to documentation claims.
4. Check audience purity — flag contributor content in user-facing pages (per
   [`references/standards.md`](references/standards.md)).
5. Run CLI examples shown in docs, verify output matches.
6. Check YAML examples against the product's JSON schema directory.
7. Verify all internal cross-links resolve.
8. Run `fit-doc build --src=websites/<site> --out=dist` to confirm
   build.
9. Check `git log --oneline -20 -- <paths>` for recent code changes that may
   have invalidated docs.

### Cross-page-consistency: re-run `<sh>` examples

For this topic, re-run each `<sh prompt>` block against starter data or the
local CLI and diff its output against the adjacent `<text>` block. Record one
row in `wiki/metrics/{skill}/{YYYY}.csv` per divergence, tagged
`kata-documentation-cross-page-consistency-sh-output-reexec`. Staleness found
in a page's prose stays with that page's own topic.

## Interactive Writing

### Writing a new page

1. **Identify the audience.** Determine which user group the page serves — this
   decides the section. See
   [`references/standards.md`](references/standards.md).
2. **Choose the section.** New to the product → Getting Started. Full workflow →
   Big Hire guide. Bounded task → Little Hire guide. Looking something up →
   Reference. Understanding the code → Internals.
3. **Research the source of truth.** Read the actual code and data before
   writing. Cross-reference
   [`references/source-of-truth.md`](references/source-of-truth.md).
4. **Write for the audience.** Strip content that belongs to a different
   audience.
5. **Verify accuracy.** Run CLI commands, check YAML against schemas, confirm
   entity names against the product's data directories.
6. **Add cross-links.** Guides → Reference for details. Getting Started → Guides
   for next steps. Internals → Reference for the user-facing model.
7. **Build and check.** Run
   `fit-doc build --src=websites/<site> --out=dist`.

### Updating existing pages

1. Read the page and its source of truth — check actual code, not just docs.
2. Check audience purity — move contributor content to Internals if needed.
3. Verify CLI examples. Run every command shown.
4. Verify YAML examples against the product's JSON schema directory.
5. Check cross-links resolve.
6. Build and check.

## Output

Every review must produce both categories when applicable. Classify each finding
with
[work-definition.md § Classification tests](../../agents/x-work-definition.md#classification-tests)
(mechanical fix vs structural spec). Branch naming, commit conventions, and
independence rules are defined in the agent profile.

**Commit format:** `docs(website): {verb} {topic} documentation`

Verbs: `add` for new pages, `update` for changes, `fix` for corrections.

### Publishing changes

Commits are not visible until pushed. After committing on a branch,
`open-change` ([work-trackers.md](../../agents/x-work-trackers.md))
with the title and body, holding the PR body to
[Citation integrity](../../agents/x-citation-integrity.md).

Each branch gets its own PR. Fix and spec branches are independent — push and PR
each one separately. Wiki changes follow the wiki curation skill's publishing
instructions.

## Memory: What to Record

Append to the current week's log (see agent profile for the file path):

- **Topic reviewed** — Which topic and why selected
- **Coverage map** — Updated table of all topics with last review date
- **Findings summary** — What found, severity, disposition
  (fixed/spec'd/deferred)
- **Deferred work** — Issues needing follow-up with enough context to resume
- **Accuracy errors** — Specific docs that diverged from source code
- **Memos sent** — Callouts dispatched via `gemba-wiki memo` to agents whose
  work affects docs
- **Metrics** — Append one row per run to `wiki/metrics/{skill}/`
  per `references/metrics.md`. See KATA.md § Metrics for the
  recording-eligibility rule.

## Coordination Channels

This skill produces these non-wiki outputs (per
[coordination-protocol.md](../../agents/x-coordination-protocol.md)):

- **PR comment** — Doc-impact callouts on code PRs that change behaviour
  documented in `websites/`.
- **Discussion** — Doc gaps that reflect an unsettled product question rather
  than a writing task.

If an inbound PR comment addressed to this agent is ambiguous, follow
[coordination-protocol.md § Inbound: unclear addressed comments](../../agents/x-coordination-protocol.md#inbound-unclear-addressed-comments).
