description: >
  Define what good engineering means so roles have clear, defensible
  expectations, and provision activity-database substrates. Use when
  defining or updating skills, capabilities, behaviours, disciplines,
  tracks, levels, or questions; when pushing rosters, syncing GetDX
  snapshots, or ingesting GitHub artifacts; or when staging a seeded
  substrate.

# Map Product

Map is the foundation of all Forward Impact products. It ships three
operator surfaces — each owns a different consumer:

- **Standard layer** — YAML validated against JSON Schema and RDF/SHACL.
  Engineering-leaders edit this directly.
- **Activity layer** — bundled Supabase project carrying
  `organization_people`, GitHub artifacts, GetDX snapshots, marker
  evidence. Leaders ingest into this over time.
- **Substrate** — a single-shot provisioning pipeline that collapses
  activity-layer setup into one verb and implements the Substrate
  Contract as views, so the generic `fit-terrain substrate` identity
  verbs run against the seeded database.

Standard and activity entities are published in structured formats so
agents can interpret them reliably.

## When to Use

- Defining or tailoring an engineering standard, or editing JSON Schema /
  RDF / SHACL definitions.
- Validating, indexing, or exporting standard data.
- Managing the activity database — starting Supabase, pushing rosters,
  syncing GetDX, reprocessing the raw bucket, verifying ingest.
- Provisioning a **substrate** — staging the database in one shot for
  persona work with `fit-terrain substrate`.

## Standard Layer

Edit YAML under `data/pathway/`. Entity files use co-located `human:` and
`agent:` sections; skills live nested inside capability files.

Run `npx fit-map validate` after every change. Validation runs in two
phases:

1. **Schema** — each YAML against its JSON Schema (the standard's
   schemas ship in `@forwardimpact/libskill` under `schema/json/`).
2. **Referential** — cross-references resolve (skill IDs in disciplines,
   behaviour IDs in tracks, track IDs in `validTracks`, driver
   `contributingSkills`/`contributingBehaviours`, level `minLevel`).

When the standard's JSON Schemas change (libskill's `schema/json/`),
update map's `schema/rdf/` in the same commit — the two formats must
stay in sync.

Generate browser indexes with `npx fit-map generate-index`. Render base
entities to HTML microdata with `npx fit-map export`. Common authoring
tasks (add a skill, add interview questions, add an agent section, add a
tool reference) live in [`references/tasks.md`](references/tasks.md).

## Activity Layer

Activity commands wrap the bundled Supabase project; consumers never
`cd` into `node_modules/@forwardimpact/map`. The CLI finds Supabase via
Homebrew, npm, or falls back to `npx supabase`.

```sh
npx fit-map activity start              # Start local Supabase
npx fit-map activity status             # Report stack health
npx fit-map activity migrate            # Reset + re-apply migrations (drops data)
npx fit-map people push <file>          # Upsert into organization_people
npx fit-map getdx sync                  # Sync GetDX (needs GETDX_API_TOKEN)
npx fit-map activity transform          # Reprocess the raw bucket
npx fit-map activity verify             # Smoke-test the database
```

`people push` and `getdx sync` write the raw payload to the `raw` bucket
first, then upsert on natural keys — safe to re-run. The same code
ships as four edge functions (`github-webhook`, `people-upload`,
`getdx-sync`, `transform`) in the bundled Supabase project for hosted
deployments.

## Substrate

One verb provisions an invariant-satisfying activity database. The
pipeline collapses the activity-layer flow above — when running
substrate, `init`, `migrate`, `seed`, `people push`, and `provision` are
all internal phases. Do not invoke them separately.

### One-shot stage

```sh
npx fit-map substrate stage --cwd <agent_dir>
```

Phases (failures surface as `[substrate stage: <phase>] <reason>` so CI
identifies the failing step):

| Phase           | What it does                                                     |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `init`          | Bootstrap `data/pathway/` + `config/config.json` into target     |
| `copy-activity` | Copy synthetic activity data into target                         |
| `stack`         | `supabase start`                                                 |
| `url-discovery` | Parse `supabase status` → set `SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` |
| `migrate`       | `supabase db reset`                                              |
| `seed`          | Load activity data                                               |
| `provision`     | Reconcile `auth.users` against the roster (shared `fit-terrain` capability) |
| `smoke`         | Invoke every gated product command end-to-end                    |

`SUBSTRATE_FORCE_EMPTY_CORPUS=true` forces the smoke phase to fail with
the empty-corpus diagnostic — used by CI to assert the failure path.

### Persona selection

Map's migrations implement the Substrate Contract as views over the
activity schema, so persona selection and credential issue run through
the generic verbs:

```sh
npx fit-terrain substrate pick --format json
npx fit-terrain substrate issue --email <e> --cwd <agent_dir> --token-env <NAME>
```

See the
[Substrate Contract](https://www.forwardimpact.team/docs/libraries/substrate-contract/index.md)
guide for the relations, invariants, and degradation semantics.
Service-account JWTs use `fit-map auth issue` — the substrate path is for
engineer personas only.

## Verification

After standard-layer changes:

```sh
npx fit-map validate
```

After substrate changes, the `smoke` phase verifies every gated
product command against the seeded database — a non-zero exit names
the failing command.
